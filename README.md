# HiLo Game

This is a repo I am using to learn more about git flow, testing and continuous integration.

## What am I using?

- I am using Python 3 with PyCharm as my IDE.
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/msm1089) is used for CI.
- Pytest is used for testing.
- May also use GitKraken to try it out, but thinking it is unnecessary as PyCharm seems to integrate well!

## Why am I doing this?

1. I feel I need more hands on experience having recently got my first job as a Developer :)
2. I think I will never have even the chance of making anything **epic** unless I skill up on the 'chore' side of things!
3. I got a load of dev tools and some access to some courses for python via a [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/monthly?refc=f6lAtW) pack. I guess I should make use of them ;)
